.SH Name
Autodiscover HTTP Service Protocol handler (AutoDiscover responder)
.SH Description
Autodiscover clients can locate the Autodiscover server for a given domain
\fIexample.com\fP by attempting to resolve the
\fB_autodiscover._tcp.\fP\fIexample.com\fP IN SRV record from DNS, and
otherwise fall back to \fBautodiscover.\fP\fIexample.com\fP.
.PP
To force using a particular Autodiscover server, such as when Gromox is run in
a development environment with a fake domain,
c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts can be populated with a static entry
for \fBautodiscover.\fP\fIexample.com\fP to get that particular scenario
working.
.PP
An Autodiscover client would make a "POST /Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml"
request to the autodiscover server that was determined moments ago. The mailbox
credentials are presented using HTTP authentication.
.PP
The Autodiscover response contains a HTTP server (generally the HTTP home
server) and the designated choice for protocol framing. A client uses this to
set up the EMSMDB MAPI service within a MAPI profile. Because the HTTP home
server is then known, Autodiscover is not used again when making a connection
to the message store service. However, the Address Book always issues
Autodiscover requests. (In other words, removing the DNS entry for the
Autodiscover server after a profile is set up would break the address book, but
not the message store.)
.SH Configuration directives
The normal config file location is /etc/gromox/autodiscover.cfg. (For backwards
compatibility, if autodiscover.cfg is not present, the module will read part of
autodiscover.ini.)
.TP
\fBoxdisco_advertise_mh\fP
This setting controls whether the AutoDiscover response should include a EXHTTP
Protocol section. Possible values: \fIyes\fP, \fIno\fP, \fInot_old_mso\fP,
\fIonly_new_mso\fP. The latter two values can be used to finely control
emission in case of clients other than Outlook.
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_advertise_rpch\fP
This setting controls whether the AutoDiscover response should include
EXCH/EXPR Protocol sections. Possible values: \fIyes\fP, \fIno\fP,
\fIonly_old_mso\fP, \fInot_new_mso\fP. The latter two values can be used to
finely control emission in case of clients other than Outlook.
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_pretty_response\fP
A debugging knob to make the module emit indented XML responses.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_request_logging\fP
Log AutoDiscover requests. This is independent of http.cfg:http_debug, and
setting both would log requests twice.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_response_logging\fP
Log AutoDiscover responses. This is independent of http.cfg:http_debug, and
setting both would log responses twice.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_validate_scndrequest\fP
When OL opens a non-default store (store of another user) or a public store, it
may also make an AutoDiscover inquiry for the extra store. This setting
controls whether the server-side AutoDiscover module should perform a
permission check on non-default stores and possibly reject returning connection
details. (Inquiry Public stores are always permitted.)
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBx500_org_name\fP
.br
Default: (unspecified)
.SH Outlook notes
When Outlook is active, it is possible to Ctrl-MouseBtn3 (right click) on the
status tray icon to call up a context menu, from which "Test Email
Autoconfiguration..." can be selected to debug AutoDiscover requests and
responses from the Windows side.
