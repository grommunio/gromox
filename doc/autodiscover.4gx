.SH Name
autodiscover \(em AutoDiscover HTTP Service Protocol handler (responder)
.SH Description
.PP
A client would make a HTTP request to the /Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml
endpoint, which is handled by the Gromox oxdisco plugin.
.PP
The Autodiscover response contains the home server name and protocol options
(MAPI-RPC-HTTP, MAPIHTTP, IMAP, etc.). A client uses this to set up the mailbox
with MAPI services (like ``MSEMS`` or ``INTERSTOR``) within a MAPI profile.
.SH Configuration directives (gromox.cfg)
The following directives are recognized when they appear in
/etc/gromox/gromox.cfg.
.TP
\fBoxdisco_advertise_mh\fP
This setting controls whether the AutoDiscover response should include a EXHTTP
Protocol section. Possible values: \fIyes\fP, \fIno\fP, \fInot_old_mso\fP,
\fIonly_new_mso\fP. The latter two values can be used to finely control
emission in case of clients other than Outlook.
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_advertise_rpch\fP
This setting controls whether the AutoDiscover response should include
EXCH/EXPR Protocol sections. Possible values: \fIyes\fP, \fIno\fP,
\fIonly_old_mso\fP, \fInot_new_mso\fP. The latter two values can be used to
finely control emission in case of clients other than Outlook.
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_exonym\fP
Globally valid name pointing to a default mailbox server in the Gromox server
forest. (Since AutoDiscover nodes are also mailbox nodes, the exonym should
simply be: this server's hostname).
.br
Default: (inherited from http.cfg:host_id, which defaults to the system FQDN)
.TP
\fBoxdisco_pretty_response\fP
A debugging knob to make the module emit indented XML responses.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_request_logging\fP
Log AutoDiscover requests. This is independent of http.cfg:http_debug, and
setting both would log requests twice.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_response_logging\fP
Log AutoDiscover responses. This is independent of http.cfg:http_debug, and
setting both would log responses twice.
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBoxdisco_validate_scndrequest\fP
When OL opens a non-default store (store of another user) or a public store, it
may also make an AutoDiscover inquiry for the extra store. This setting
controls whether the server-side AutoDiscover module should perform a
permission check on non-default stores and possibly reject returning connection
details. (Inquiry of public stores are always permitted.)
.br
Default: \fIyes\fP
.TP
\fBx500_org_name\fP
.br
Default: (unspecified)
.SH Configuration directives (autodiscover.cfg)
The following directives are recognized when they appear in
/etc/gromox/autodiscover.cfg. autodiscover.cfg is obsolete in favor of
gromox.cfg.
.TP
\fBx500_org_name\fP
Same as gromox.cfg:x500_org_name.
.br
Default: (unspecified)
.SH Configuration directives (autodiscover.ini)

.SH Outlook notes

status tray icon to call up a context menu, from which "Test Email
Autoconfiguration..." can be selected to debug AutoDiscover requests and
responses from the Windows side.

In EXC, MH can be toggled on/off via an EAC Shell command:
`Set-OrganizationConfig -MapiHttpEnable $false` (or $true).
