.SS Description
This command hard-deletes messages from a store, including issuing proper
PR_CHANGE_KEY metadata updates for the sake of Cached Mode clients.
.PP
The folder and message IDs taken as arguments on the command-line should be
of the GC-value form, i.e. as they appear in the the SQLite database.
.SS Subcommand options
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIfolder_id\fP
The folder from which to delete the messages. (If a msgid is specified which is
not located in the particular folder, that message will not be deleted.)
.TP
\fB\-\-soft\fP
Perform a soft deletion. (This feature is experimental.) Default is hard.
.SH unload
Normally, exmdb_provider(4gx) keeps stores open for up to
exmdb_provider.cfg:cache_interval. The "unload_store" RPC to
exmdb_provider(4gx) causes the sqlite database (in
/var/lib/gromox/.../exmdb/exchange.sqlite3) to be closed. Any subsequent RPC
may reopen it, though. The unload RPC is useful after a mailbox was deleted
and/or reinitialized with grommunio-admin-api or tools like
gromox-mkprivate(8)/gromox-mkpublic(8). [zcore also has store state in memory.
This would also need to be purged \(em but there is no RPC for such action at
this time.]
.SH vacuum
The "vacuum" RPC makes exmdb_provider issue the SQLite "vacuum" command on
exchange.sqlite3, which rebuilds and compacts the database file.
