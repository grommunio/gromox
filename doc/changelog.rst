  with the email address even if the user's common name was umlaut-free
* ews: PR_LAST_MODIFIER_NAME was filled with the email address even if the
  user's common name was umlaut-free


Gromox 2.43 (2025-03-06)
========================

Fixes:

* imap: reduce memory footprint when FETCHing messages
* imap: resolve shutdown ordering crash
* exmdb: upgrade 0-length PR_ENTRYIDs to fake 1 byte to soothe Outlook Cached
  Mode syncer
* ews: heed MAPI proptype semantics and interpret 0xffffffff as a signed int
  when serializing to XML (-1 rather than 4294967295)
* gab: resolve out-of-bounds access in dntomid

Enhancements:

* oxm2mt: support embedded messages

Gromox 2.42 (2025-02-19)
========================

Fixes:

* exmdb_local: plug memory leak resulting from RPC execution

Enhancements:

* nsp: a few more RPCs now emit log messages under nsp_trace=2
* mh_nsp: support transfer of additional undocumented property types
* oxdisco: recognize /mail/config-v1.1.xml URI

Behavioral changes:

* New internal addressbook implementation backing the NSPI-provided and
  Zcore-provided AB functionality.

Packaging changes:

* dscli: DNS resolution via LDNS/libldns (desirable for linux-musl and BSDs)

  activated
* midb, imap: print asynchronous notification events when imap_cmd_debug>=2
* oxcical: invalid iCal timezone inputs are now logged when
  <daemon>_log_level=6 (debug)

Behavioral changes:

* mkprivate: new message stores now have `frightsVisible` set on the calendar
  folder, because grommunio-web is picky about the existence of the calendar
  folder even if obtaining just freebusy blocks.


Gromox 2.40 (2025-01-28)
========================

Fixes:

* zcore: avoid unwrapping Content-Transfer-Encoding twice for
  clearsigned S/MIME
* ews: calculate timezone offsets for local time only

Enhancements:

* When using import tools, no longer overwrite PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME with
  the current time; retain the original timestamp if one exists.
* mbop: new foreach.* command group which replaces for-all-users

Behavioral changes:

* The default value for the ``outgoing_smtp_url`` config directive changed
  to ``sendmail://`` (using postdrop rather than direct SMTP contact).

* email_lib: on vCard ingestion, treat ORG lines as the structured field that
  they are specified as, rather than as one text value
* exmdb_local: autovivify new named properties on delivery, fixing log message
  ``D-1220: cu_set_properties called with PR_NULL`` when ingesting a vCard
  message into an empty store via SMTP/LMTP
* dbop_sqlite: avoid use of the ``UNIXEPOCH`` function since it is not
  available in AlmaLinux 9

Changes:

* stderr being a tty previously overruled daemons' log_file

  changed and http_log_file has precedence over any tty-ness of stderr.


Gromox 2.36 (2024-11-06)
========================

Fixes:

* ews: fix an ABA locking problem when EWS unsubscribe actions were processed
* genimport: fix a data juggling issue that led to mt2exm printing ``proptag …
  from input stream has no named property info``
* mbck: do not attempt to repair allocated_eids if repair mode was not
  selected, fixing mbck printing ``sqlite3_prep(INSERT INTO allocated_eids) …
  inside a readonly TXN``.
* exmdb: fix an issue where creating new messages-embedded-in-messages could
  lead to ``sqlite3_exec(… INSERT INTO messages … VALUES (65536, …): UNIQUE
  constraint failed: messages.message_id (19)``, for msgids very close to the
  end of the block
* mkprivate et al: fix an issue where force-overwriting databases would print
  ``database is locked``

  zero-length attachment for a zero-length mail

Enhancements:

* mbop: new commands "ping", "for-all-users", "echo-username"
* exmdb: faster process shutdown through parallelized closing of sqlite files
* exmdb: better location diagnostics for RO-RO transactions, for RW-in-RO,
  and ROLLBACK issues

Changes:

* exmdb: the default value for exmdb_provider.cfg:cache_interval (time until
  inactive sqlite files are closed) was reduced from 2h to 15min to curb system
  resource use
* exmdb: the default value for exmdb_provider.cfg:populating_threads_num
  (asynchronous search folder population threads) from 50 to 4 to curb system
  resource use

  database schema, it takes too much time
* (Integrity checks can still be done offline with ``mkprivate -U --integ``)

========================

Fixes:

* alias_resolve: resolve nullptr deref crash
* ews: resolve nullptr deref crash

========================

Fixes:

* oxdisco: serve TB Autoconfig XML without requiring authentication
  (clients do not expect it to be protected)
* oxcical: revert commit which evaluates different MAPI timezone properties to
  generate DTSTART/DTEND's TZID value

Enhancements:

* oxcmail: Implement MIME fragment joining for the construction of the
  contents of PR_HTML.
  That is, MIME parts which have declared ``Content-Type: multipart/mixed`` and
  where the first subpart of the Mixed container is ``text/html`` now trigger
  the creation of a "jumbo" HTML document where other subparts of types
  ``text/plain`` and further ``text/html`` from that container, are integrated.
* dscli: add --ac option to test Mail Autoconfig (what Thunderbird uses
  in leu of AutoDiscover)
* http: credential caching for HTTP Basic (config directive
  ``http_basic_auth_cred_caching``, defaulting to 60s)

Changes:

* The user_filter(4gx) plugin was replaced by a new implementation.
  user_filter.cfg is no longer read. New config directives (with new names)
  are in gromox.cfg.

  like a hang


Gromox 2.31 (2024-08-14)
========================

Fixes:

* freebusy: get_freebusy erroneously underreported occurrences for
  yearly occurrences
* freebusy: the get_freebusy routine erroneously landed in an infinite loop if
  a yearly-recurring February 29 appointment was originally created in a year
  not divisible by 12.

Enhancements:

* oxcmail: take /etc/mime.types under consideration when adding extensions
  to attachments

Changes:

* oxcmail: priorities for MIME parts have been rectified for
  multipart/alternative and non-alternative containers; the conversion routine
  is no longer making picks across multiple container siblings.


2.30 (2024-06-21)
=================

Fixes:

* exmdb: instace_load_message RPC with unsynthesizable properties will no
  longer yield an erroneous error

* exmdb: delete leftover stray ROLLBACK statement
* ews: cure null dereference in tInternetMessageHeader::parse
* ews: use vmime parser to break down IMHs and reset an Apple workaround for
  "From" lines

Changes:

* emsmdb: attempt to synthesize PR_SENDER_ADDRTYPE &
  PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_ADDRTYPE when they are missing (also warn when those
  properties are deleted)

========================

Fixes:

  to help correlate which actions are executed by which user

Changes:

* remote_delivery.cfg is obsolete! If you need an SMTP relay for outgoing mail
  (and you do not have a local postfix to take care of that), you should set
  gromox.cfg:outgoing_smtp_url.

* http: do not terminate if an illegal ``outgoing_smtp_url`` is used
* http: avoid garbage From line in non-delivery reports generated by
  OP_BOUNCE rules

Changes:

* oxcmail: export no longer generates a MIME epilogue, which should
  workaround Outlook's broken S/MIME validator which fails to include
  epilogues in the signature verification.

========================

Fixes:

  directive ``zcore_max_obh_per_session``)

Behavioral changes:

* http: the file descriptor table limit is by default set to the environment
  hard limit (instead of 2256 fds, one will have 512K in Linux-systemd
  environments now)
* php_mapi: do not convert freebusy_event_details fields which are not available


Gromox 2.19 (2023-12-04)
========================

  property during ICS downloads as an error any longer

Behavioral changes:

* oxcmail: zero-length headers are ignored altogether (inspired by Alpine's
  behavior in that regard)

* daemons: support for alternate login names
  (this allows for assigning shorter usernames for grommunio-web)
* exmdb: augment create_folder and movecopy_folder RPCs with a 32-bit error
  code, which allows g-web to better detect folders with duplicate names
* ews: implement Subscribe, Unsubscribe, GetEvents, GetUserPhoto
* mbop: add subcommand `clear-rwz` to clear out RuleOrganizer FAI messages

Behavioral changes:

* exmdb: the delivery_message RPC will now return with status "partial_write"
  if major parts of a message (body/attachments) could not be written
  (disk full/permission denied/etc.)
* delivery: partially-written messages now lead to bounce generation and
  emergency save action to disk


Gromox 2.16 (2023-10-29)
========================

Fixes:

* oxvcard: export to .vcf now positions the VERSION property in accordance with
  the vCard 4.0 specification.
* oxcmail: cease gratuitous RTF conversion of calendar items
* mysql_adaptor: a wrong string search was used for recipient delimiters,
  which could lead to Recipient Invalid/User Not Found

Enhancements:

  mailbox").
* emsmdb, zcore: the ``emsmdb_max_cxh_per_user``,
  ``emsmdb_max_obh_per_session`` and ``zcore_max_obh_per_session`` config
  directives can now be set to 0 for unlimited.


Gromox 2.15 (2023-10-18)
========================

Fixes:

* imap: do not emit continuation request on LITERAL+
  (now also for large literals >64K)
* exmdb: ignore softdeleted folders when validating new folder name
* exmdb: explicitly rollback SQLite transactions when the commit operation
  failed, to resolve cases of ``cannot start a transaction within a
  transaction``

Enhancements:

* delivery: support for plus-addresses/recipient delimiters,
  e.g. <user+extension@example.com>
* delivery: new config directive ``lda_recipient_delimiters``
* mbop: new subcommand ``recalc-size`` to recalculate store size

Changes:

* alias_resolve: config directives are no longer read from
  ``/etc/gromox/alias_resolve.cfg`` but now from ``/etc/gromox/gromox.cfg``
* oxcmail: do not emit Content-Disposition creation-time/modification-time
  parameters when those fields are not present in the MAPI object
* Delete unused columns and indexes from the ``associations`` MariaDB table;
  (grommunio-admin-api should be updated to >= 1.12)

Last-minute notes:

* When gromox-dbop attempts to upgrade to table schema version 127, an SQL
  query is issued to set a new PRIMARY KEY on a table. It has been brought to
  our attention that somewhat older MariaDB server versions (namely 10.4.13,
  10.4.22) contain a bug/not_implemented_feature which makes this query never
