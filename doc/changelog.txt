0.18 (2021-03-26)
=================
Changes:
* http: Split some unspecific HTTP 500 errors into 500, 502, 503, 504.
* http: Incomplete RTF documents are now decoded rather than "Not Found"
  being emitted.
* mod_cache: added the /web path to the built-in defaults
* mod_fastcgi: fix php-fpm yielding Not Found for /web
* mod_fastcgi: changed the underlying path of the built-in rule for
  /web to /usr/share/grammm-web
* The systemd .target units were removed
Fixes:
* zcore: moving mails between two stores had erroneously used the
  old mail folder's id for deletion and failed.
* daemons: Fix a crash when programs shut down before entering the mainloop.


0.17 (2021-03-06)
=================
Enhancements:
* http: Raise max_router_connections & max_rpc_stub_threads limits
  to cope with reconnect storms from midb and zcore.
* doc: manpage for autodiscover
Changes:
* all daemons: Disabled the ip6_container and ip6_filter plugins
  for now; the default settings block too many connections.
Fixes:
* http: fix crash when user_default_lang is unset
* imap: advertise STARTTLS when indeed supported
* all daemons: avoid rejecting IPv6 connections from long addresses

  optional now; built-in defaults will be used if absent.
