.SH Name
http \(em Central server for RPC and the message database
.SH Synopsis
\fBhttp\fP [\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\fP]
.SH Description
http(8gx) is a trivial HTTP server. It understands the special HTTP methods as
used by RPC-over-HTTP protocol as used by Outlook, it can serve files verbatim,
or forward requests to a FastCGI server such as php-fpm(8).
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\fP
Read configuration directives from the given file. If this option is not
specified, /etc/gromox/http.cfg will be read if it exists.
.TP
\fB\-?\fP
Display option summary.
.SH URI processing order
.IP \(bu 4
Requests are passed to the mod_rewrite(4gx) module (built-in) to have their URI
potentially rewritten.
.IP \(bu 4
If a HTTP request is using the methods RPC_IN_DATA or RPC_OUT_DATA, the data
stream is handed off to the exchange_emsmdb(4gx) plugin.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, HTTP processing modules (HPM) are invoked. Processing ends when
one module signals that the request was handled. The order depends on the HPM
list (cf. http.cfg(5gx):\fBhpm_plugin_list\fP).
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the mod_fastcgi(4gx) module (built-in) is invoked. Processing ends
if the module handled the request.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the mod_cache(4gx) module (built-in) is invoked. Processing ends
if the module handled the request.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the request is rejected.
.SH RPC-over-HTTP
RPC-over-HTTP utilizes two special HTTP methods, RPC_IN_DATA and RPC_OUT_DATA.
These requests can, similarly to HTTP CONNECT, be very long-lived. The RPC data
stream is handled by the included exchange_emsmdb(4gx) plugin.

Default: \fI/usr/share/gromox/http\fP
.TP
\fBfastcgi_cache_size\fP
If the HTTP request to a CGI endpoint uses Chunked Transfer Encoding and the
Content-Length field contains a larger value than this limit, the data is
buffered in a file \fI/tmp/http-\fP%d (%d replaced by internal context id).
.br
Default: \fI256K\fP
.TP
\fBfastcgi_exec_timeout\fP
Maximum execution time for CGI scripts.
.br
Default: \fI10 minutes\fP

If the Content-Length of a HTTP request to a CGI endpoint is larger than this
value, the request is rejected.
.br
Default: \fI4M\fP
.TP
\fBhost_id\fP
A unique identifier for this system. It is used for the Server HTTP responses
header, for service plugins like exmdb_provider(4gx), which makes use of it for
SMTP HELO lines, for DSN report texts, for MIDB database/EML cache. The
identifier should only use characters allowed for hostnames.
.br
Default: (system hostname)
.TP
\fBhpm_cache_size\fP
If the HTTP request to a HPM endpoint uses Chunked Transfer Encoding and the
Content-Length field contains a larger value than this limit, the data is
buffered in a file \fI/tmp/http-\fP%d (%d replaced by internal context id).
.br
Default: \fI512K\fP
.TP
\fBhpm_max_size\fP
If the Content-Length of a HTTP request to a HPM endpoint is larger than this
value, the request is rejected.
.br
Default: \fI4M\fP
.TP
\fBhpm_plugin_ignore_errors\fP
If set to yes, HTTP processing modules that fail to load on startup are
ignored. If set to no, the daemon will exit if any plugin cannot be loaded.

The number of login tries a user is allowed before the account is blocked.

The password to unlock TLS certificates.
.br
Default: (unset)
.TP
\fBhttp_certificate_path\fP
Filesystem path to a certificate file for use with encrypted connection. The

Filesystem path to the key file needed to unlock the TLS certificate.
.br
