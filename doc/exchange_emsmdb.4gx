.SH Name
exchange_emsmdb(4gx) \(em http(8gx) processing plugin for the Wire Format
Protocol (Outlook/Exchange RPCs).
.SH Description
exchange_emsmdb is a processing plugin for http(8gx) which handles the remote
procedure calls for the EMSMDB v1 and AsyncEMSMDB v1 RPC interfaces, as well as
OXCROPS as issued by the EcDoRpcExt2 call or the MAPIHTTP EXECUTE call.
.PP
EMSMDB is a DCE/RPC interface with just a few RPC calls (6 are still used
today). ecDoRpcExt2, a call offered by that interface, takes an opaque byte
buffer argument not interpreted by DCE/RPC. That byte buffer contains another
protocol, "Remote Operation(s) Encoding Protocol" [OXCROPS]. No reason for this
wrapping is given in the OXCRPC spec. MAPIHTTP runs OXCROPS directly without
the extra EMSMDB framing.
.PP
OXCROPS consists of 130 calls that make up the mailbox protocol.
.SH Configuration directives (gromox.cfg)
The following directives are recognized when they appear in
/etc/gromox/gromox.cfg.
.TP
\fBoutgoing_smtp_url\fP
The SMTP server to use for outgoing mails. To use the local maildrop queue, set
the value to \fIsendmail://localhost\fP. smtp:// is unqueued(!), and if the
SMTP server is offline, submissions will be rejected (and mails stick around in
Outbox or whatever folder they were submitted from).
.br
Default: \fIsendmail://localhost\fP
.SH Configuration directives (exchange_emsmdb.cfg)
The following directives are recognized when they appear in
/etc/gromox/exchange_emsmdb.cfg.
.TP
\fBasync_threads_num\fP
Default: \fI4\fP
.TP
\fBems_max_active_notifh\fP
Maximum number of concurrently active notify handles.
.br
Default: (unlimited)
.TP
\fBems_max_active_sessions\fP
Maximum number of concurrently active EMSMDB sessions. The special value 0
indicates unlimited. The special value 0 indicates unlimited. EMSMDB sessions
are not tied to any particular TCP connection; sessions terminate by means of
an explicit "ecDoDisconnect" request, or by an inactivity timer (currently 2000
seconds). MFCMAPI sends ecDoDisconnect, but Outlook just breaks off TCP
connections, so sessions can pile up.
.br
Default: (unlimited)
.TP
\fBems_max_active_users\fP
Maximum number of concurrently active EMSMDB session owners (users). The
special value 0 indicates unlimited.
.br
Default: (unlimited)
.TP
\fBems_max_pending_sesnotif\fP
Maximum number of pending notifications for an EMSMDB session. [Content tables
on search folders can rack up enormous amounts of notifications, so worry not
upon seeing W-2305 warnings in the log.]
.br
Default: \fI1K\fP
.TP
\fBemsmdb_max_cxh_per_user\fP
The maximum number of EMSMDB sessions (CXH = RPC context handle) for one user.
The special value 0 indicates unlimited. EMSMDB sessions are not tied to any
particular TCP connection; sessions terminate by means of an explicit
"ecDoDisconnect" request, or by an inactivity timer (currently 2000 seconds).
Outlook does not send ecDoDisconnect (MFCMAPI does), so sessions can pile up.
.br
Default: \fI100\fP
.TP
\fBemsmdb_max_obh_per_session\fP
The maximum number of object handles (e.g. folders/messages/etc.) each ROP
logon (contrary to the name, not EMSMDB session) can have at any one time
concurrently. Use 0 to indicate unlimited. On average, Outlook creates six ROP
logons per mailbox that it opens.
.br
Default: \fI500\fP
.TP
\fBemsmdb_private_folder_softdel\fP
Enables soft-delete support for folders in private stores. (This feature is
experimental.) Public folders always have this on. (Take note that
exmdb_provider.cfg:exmdb_private_folder_softdelete also need to be enabled.)
.br
Default: \fIno\fP
.TP
\fBemsmdb_rop_chaining\fP
0: Deactivate ROP chaining. 1: Enable ROP chaining for OL < 15 and OL >=
16.0.10000 (OL2019, OL2021, OLM365). 2: Enabled for all clients.
.br
Default: \fI1\fP
.TP
\fBmailbox_ping_interval\fP
Default: \fI5 minutes\fP
.TP
\fBmail_max_length\fP
The maximum size for any individual attachment and message. Attempts to store
objects larger than this are rejected. The upper limit is 2G, imposed by
Exchange protocols.
.br
Default: \fI64M\fP
.TP
\fBmax_ext_rule_length\fP
Default: \fI510K\fP
.TP
\fBmax_mail_num\fP
The maximum number of mails that a mailbox is allowed to have.
.br
Default: \fI1000000\fP
.TP
\fBmax_rcpt_num\fP
The maximum number of recipients that an e-mail is allowed to have.
.br
Default: \fI256\fP
.TP
\fBrop_debug\fP
Log every incoming OXCROP call and the return code of the operation in a
minimal fashion. Level 1 emits ROPs with a failure return code, level 2 emits
all ROPs. Note the daemon log level needs to be "debug" (6), too.
.br
Default: \fI0\fP
.TP
\fBsubmit_command\fP
Default: \fI/usr/bin/php /usr/share/gromox/sa/submit.php
.TP
\fBx500_org_name\fP
Default: (unspecified)

.SH Outlook notes
Outlook can be started with the \fB/rpcinfo\fP command-line parameter to
display a status table about the RPC connections it has open. Alternatively,
one can Ctrl-MouseBtn3 (right button) on the status tray icon to call up a
context menu, from which "Connection status..." can be selected for the same.
.SH Signals
When SIGUSR1 is received by this module, it will dump an overview of current
EMSMDB sessions to the configured log device (stderr/journal by default).
EMSMDB sessions are not linked to any one HTTP connection in particular,
and multiple HTTP connections may exercise one session.
