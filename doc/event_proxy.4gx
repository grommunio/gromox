.SH Name
event_stub \(em event sender service plugin
.SH Description
event_proxy connects to the event(8gx) daemon and sets itself up so as to be
able to send notifications.
.PP
event_proxy installs three service functions, "broadcast_event",
"broadcast_select" and "broadcast_unselect", though the latter two are just
convenience functions for broadcast_event. broadcast_event is for synchronously
sending a notification into the event distribution system. Arbitrary
notifications and commands can be sent this way. The return value is ignored.
.PP
In practice, midb(8gx), imap(8gx) and pop3(8gx) issue FOLDER-TOUCH
notifications. Only imap(8gx) issues MESSAGE-FLAG notifications.
